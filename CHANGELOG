ChangeLog
*********

0.19.0 (2016-04-04)
===================
- Feature: WaterButler now runs on Python 3.5!  A major speed boost should be
noticeable, especially for zipped folder downloads.  All hail @chrisseto and
@TomBaxter for seeing this through!
- Feature: Zipped folder downloads now use the folder name as the zip filename.  If the folder
is the storage root, the name is `$provider.zip` (e.g. `googledrive.zip`).
- Code: WaterButlerPath has a new `is_folder` method. It's the same as `is_dir`.
- Code: waterbutler.core.BaseProvider learned `path_from_metadata`.

0.18.4 (2016-04-01)
===================
- Fix: Bump PyJWE dependency to 1.0.0 to match with OSF v0.66.0

0.18.3 (2016-03-28)
===================
- Fix: Renaming a Google doc (.gdoc, .gsheet) file should not and no longer truncates the new
filename to just the first letter.

0.18.2 (2016-03-17)
===================
- The "Leprechauns Ate My Blob" emergency release!
- Fix: Don't throw an error if the github file being requested is larger than 1Mb.  There will
be a more correct fix in the next minor release.

0.18.1 (2016-03-15)
===================
- Fix: Stop crashing if the `Content-Length` header is not set on a v1 folder create request.
A missing `Content-Length` is fine for folder create requests.

0.18.0 (2016-03-09)
===================
- BREAKING v1 API CHANGE (sortof):  Updating a file by issuing a PUT to its parent folder and
passing its name as a query parameter is no longer supported and will now throw a 409 Conflict.
This is still the correct way to create a file, but updating must be done by issuing the PUT to
the file's own endpoint.  This was supposed to be fixed back in December, but I (@felliott) did
a **very** poor job of it, meaning some providers still allowed it.  The API documentation has
been updated to match.  If you use the `/links/upload` action from the JSON-API response, you
**DO NOT** need to update your code,  That link is already correct.
- Feature: DELETEing a file or folder in the GDrive provider now sends it to the trash instead
or hard-deleting it.
- Feature: Issuing a DELETE to the storage root of a provider will now clear out its content,
but not delete the storage root itself.  This was undefined behavior before.  Some providers
would disallow it, some would crash, others would do the right thing.  This is now officially
supported.  To make sure the file contents are not wiped out on accident, the query parameter
`confirm_delete=1` must be passed when clearing the contents.  Otherwise, WB will return a 400.
- Fix: GoogleDrive provider now returns 201 Created when creating and 200 OK when overwriting
during copy operations.
- Fix: Copying / moving empty folders into a directory with a similarly named folder with 'keep
both' semantics no longer overwrites old folder and properly increments the new file name.
- Fix: Always set `kind` parameter for files and folders in v1 logging callback to avoid crashing
the OSF waterbutler logging endpoint.
- Fix: For 'keep both' conflict semantics when more than one incremented version already exists.
- Fix: Github move/copy folder requests with 'replace' semantics now correctly overwrites the
target folder, rather than merging the contents.
- Docs: @TomBaxter++ has added more docstrings to the base provider and has started documenting
the quirks of our existing providers.
- Docs: v0.18.0 WaterButler DO NOT work with python 3.5.  3.4 is required.  Mention this.
- Docs: The Center for Open Science is hiring! (thanks, @andrewsallans!)

0.17.0 (2016-02-29)
===================
- LEAP DAY RELEASE!
- Feature: Add throttling to make_request!   Some hosts don't like it when we fire off too many
requests at once.  Now we limit it to 10 requests / second and a maximum of 5 concurrently.  To
adjust the rates, update the REQUEST_LIMIT and OP_CONCURRENCY attributes in settings.py. (thanks
@chrisseto!)
- Fix: Update dropbox API urls.

0.16.5 (2016-02-22)
===================
- No changes. Applied and reverted throttling patches.

now documented, and waterbutler.core.metadata, waterbutler.core.path have
a lot more docstrings.  A skeleton overview of WaterButler is available.  More
to come...
