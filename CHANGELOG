ChangeLog
*********

0.33.0 (2017-08-09)
===================
- ANNOUNCEMENT!  The WaterButler v0 API is DEPRECATED!  COS no longer uses it and has moved
entirely to the v1 API.  It will be removed in the first release after October 1.  If you depend on
v0, please get in contact with us (contact@cos.io) before then, and let us know.
- Feature: WaterButler now supports Bitbucket as a read-only provider!  As a read-only provider,
you can browse, download, download-as-zip, get file revision history, and copy out of your
connected Bitbucket repository.
- Feature: Sentry errors now include provider and resource as searchable parameters. (thanks,
@abought!)
- Fix: Correctly describe the response of folder intra-move actions in GoogleDrive as folders,
rather than files.
- Fix: WaterButler now correctly throttles multiple parallel requests.  The maximum number of
simultaneous requests is set by the waterbutler.settings.OP_CONCURRENCY config variable.

0.32.3 (2017-07-20)
===================
- Fix: Quiet some overly-verbose error logging.

0.32.2 (2017-07-09)
===================
- Fix: Fix hanging figshare uploads by replacing a StreamReader.readexactly call with a
StreamReader.read.  The underlying cause of this problem is still unknown.

0.32.1 (2017-07-07)
===================
- Fix: Correctly format the Last-Modified header returned from v1 HEAD requests. WB had been
setting it to the datetime format used by the provider, but we should be following the format laid
out by RFC 7232, S2.2.  (thanks, @icereval and @luizirber!)

0.32.0 (2017-06-14)
===================
- Fix: Send back the correct modified date when uploading a file to osfstorage. osfstorage had
been sending back the modified date of the stored blob rather than the metadata from the OSF.
- Fix: Support metadata and revisions for files shared on Google Drive with view- or comment-only
permissions. Google Drive forbids access to the version-listing endpoint for these sorts of files,
and WaterButler was not coping with that gracefully.
- Fix: Update WaterButler tests to work on Python >= v3.5.3. A change to coroutine function
detection in Python v3.5.3 and v3.6.0 was causing tests to fail, as the mocked coroutines were not
being properly unwrapped.
- Code: Add type annotations and a mypy test to the core WaterButler provider and the box, dropbox,
googledrive, and figshare providers!  And lo, a new era of type-safety, strictness, and peace was
ushered in, and its name was `inv mypy`. (thanks, @abought!)
- Code: Add support for code-coverage checking via coveralls.io. (thanks, @abought!)

0.31.1 (2017-06-01)
===================
- Fix: Fix OwnCloud issue that could result in folder creation outside the base folder.  OwnCloud
was making assumptions about the formatting of the base folder that were not necessarily true.

0.31.0 (2017-04-07)
===================
- Feature: Stop creating empty commits on GitHub when the requested action doesn't change the tree
e.g. when updating a file with the exact same content as before.
- Fix: Moving or copying a folder within osfstorage will now return the metadata for the folder's
children in the response.
- Fix: Reject PATCH requests gracefully, instead of 500-ing.
- Fix: Disallow accessing Google Docs (.gdoc, .gsheet, etc.) without the extension.
- Fix: Fix poor error handling in Dropbox provider.
- Fix: Log WaitTimeoutErrors as log level info to Sentry. These are expected and shouldn't be
considered full errors.

0.30.0 (2017-02-02)
===================
- Feature: Support the new London and Central Canada regions in Amazon S3. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Feature: Include provider-specific metrics in metric logging payloads, including number of
requests issued.
- Fix: Don't crash when fetching file revision metadata from Google Drive.
- Fix: WaterButler docs are once again building on readthedocs.org! (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Code: Update WaterButler to use invoke 0.13.0. If you have an existing checkout, you will need to
upgrade invoke manually: pip install invoke==0.13.0 (thanks, @johnetordoff!)
- Code: Postman collections to test file and folder copy behavior for providers have been added to
tests/postman/.  See docs/testing.rst for instructions on setting up and running them.
- Docs: WaterButler has been verified to work with python 3.5.3 and 3.6.0. From now on, the docs
will mention which python versions WB has been verfied to work on. (thanks, @johnetordoff!)

0.29.1 (2017-01-04)
===================
- Happy New Year!
- Fix: Be more ruthless about fixing setuptools breakage in Dockerfile. (thanks, @cwisecarver!)

0.29.0 (2016-12-14)
===================
- Feature: WaterButler now uses the V2 APIs for both Dropbox and Figshare.
- Feature: Add a created timestamp to osfstorage file metadata.
- Feature: Support the new Mumbai and Ohio regions in Amazon S3. (thanks, @erinspace!)
- Feature: The server logs a message on startup, instead of just staring blankly at you.
- Fix: Start appending extensions to Google Doc files to disambiguate identically-named
files. e.g. foo.docx vs. foo.gsheet

0.28.1 (2016-12-13)
===================
- Pin setuptools to v30.4.0 to avoid package-namespace-related breakage.

0.28.0 (2016-10-31)
===================
- HALLOWEEN RELEASE! (^ ,–, ^)
- Feature: Download-as-zip now includes empty directories! (thanks, @darioncassel!)
- Feature: WaterButler now lists the full contents of Google Drive directories with more than 1,000
children. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Feature: WaterButler now lists the full contents of Box.com directories with more than 1,000
children. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Fix: Teach ownCloud to be more efficient about moving and copying files with a single provider.

0.27.1 (2016-10-24)
===================
- Fix: Fix broken Download-as-zip for GitHub by propagating the target branch during recursive
traversal.
- Fix: Fix incorrectly detected self-overwrite when copying a file between the root paths of two
separate Box.com accounts.

0.27.0 (2016-10-19)
===================
- Feature: Attempting to move or copy a file over itself will now fail with a 409 Conflict, even
across different resources.
- Fix: Fix bugs in ownCloud provider that were breaking renames.
- Fix: v1 metadata requests now accept the `version` and `revision` query parameters like v0.

0.26.1 (2016-10-18)
===================
- Feature: Dockerized WaterButler can now take a commit sha from the environment to indicate
version to deploy. (thanks, @icereval!)

0.26.0 (2016-10-11)
===================
- Feature: WaterButler now supports ownCloud as a full provider! (thanks, @kwierman!)
- Feature: WaterButler accepts configuration from the environment, overriding any file-based
configuration.  This helps WB integrate nicer in a docker-compose environment. (thanks, @icereval!)
- Fix: Gracefully handle branch-related GitHub errors.
- Code: Start labeling user-caused errors as level=info in Sentry (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Code: Log redirect-based downloads to analytics.
- Code: Bump dependencies on Raven and cryptography.  cryptography v1.5.2 now installs on OSX via
wheel.  This should silence scary-sounding cffi warnings!

0.25.0 (2016-09-22)
===================
- Feature: Include user id when requesting files from osfstorage, to allow the OSF to distinguish
contributing users in download counts. (thanks, @darioncassel!)

0.24.0 (2016-09-14)
===================
- Feature: Update the v1 API to passthrough unrecognized query params to the provider.
- Feature: Teach the GitHub provider to accept branch identifiers in the URL and body of v1
operations.  You can now do cross-branch move/copies with the v1 API!
- Feature: The GitHub provider now includes the branch operated on in its callback logs.
- Fix: Add `--pty` arguments to invoke install and invoke wheelhouse, to support building WB Docker
images without pseudoterminals. (thanks, @emetsger!)

0.23.3 (2016-08-31)
===================
- Fix: Fix flake error in remote_logging. Not at all embarrassing.

0.23.2 (2016-08-31)
===================
- Fix: For analytics, convert byte sizes into more convenient units.
- Code: in sizes.py, call kilobytes "KBs", not "Bs"

0.23.1 (2016-08-31)
===================
- Fix: Dataverse changed their API file metadata repsonse format. Update provider to handle both
formats.

0.23.0 (2016-08-25)
===================
- Code: Rewrite public file action logging to sync with MFR.
- Docs: Document intra_move and intra_copy in core provider.

0.22.1 (2016-08-19)
===================
- Fix: Don't try to derive modified_utc for osfstorage files that lack a modified date.

0.22.0 (2016-08-19)
===================
- Feature: File metadata now includes a modified_utc field that is the modified timestamp in
standard ISO-8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM::SS+00:00). (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Feature: Metadata for osfstorage files will contain the file GUID, once the OSF is updated to
return that information. (thanks, @Johnetordoff!)
- Feature: WaterButler can now log file actions to Keen.io.
- Fix: core.utils.async_retry was always intended to be fire-and-forget, but wasn't when await()-ed.
It will now run until done, instead of executing one retry per await.  The tests have been updated
to match this behavior.
- Fix: Update copy and move celery tasks so that a failed logging callback will not make them return
a 500.  Now they always return the result and metadata of the move/copy action.
- Fix: Logging callbacks are now retried five times, no matter where they are called from.
- Fix: Update Dockerfile to register plugins.
- Fix: Correct minor typos and links to Python and aiohttp in the docs.

0.21.4 (2016-08-02)
===================
- Fix: Ask Box not to zip our download requests. (thanks, @caseyrygt!)

0.21.3 (2016-08-01)
===================
- Fix: Bump wheel dep to 0.26.0 to fix travis build.

0.21.2 (2016-08-01)
===================
- Fix: Pin cryptography to v1.3.4 to avoid v1,4 incompatibilities with OS X's vendor openssl.
(thanks, @erinspace!)

0.21.1 (2016-07-12)
===================
- Fix: Stop duplicating parent folder when searching Google Drive for Google docs.  (thanks,
@TomBaxter!)

0.21.0 (2016-06-16)
===================
- Feature: Allow cross origin requests when an Authorization header is provided without
cookies.  (thanks, @samchrisinger!)
- Feature: Don't set any CORS headers if Origin is not provided (e.g. non-browser client)
- Fix: v0's copy action now checks can_intra_copy instead of can_intra_move.
- Fix: Stop sending requests to GitHub with the `application/vnd.github.VERSION.raw` media-type.
Start sending them `application/vnd.github.v3.raw`.
- Fix: Our API docs had typos in the example URLs.  For shame.
- Code: Refactor logging callback into one location.  Previously, v0 creates, v0 move/copies, v1
actions, and the move/copy celery tasks each had their own bespoke code for logging actions to the
authorizer-provided callback.  All of that has been merged into one method with a common interface.
This shouldn't have any user-visible changes, but it will make the developers' lives much easier.
- Code: Remove unused code from googledrive provider
- Code: WaterButlerPath learned `materialized_path()` (a.k.a its __str__ representation).

0.20.4 (2016-06-16)
===================
- Finish support for zipfiles > 4Gb.  Large zipfiles should now be uncompressible by
double-clicking on the zipfiles in OS X, Windows, and Linux.  On OS X, /usr/bin/ditto and
The Unarchiver have been confirmed to work. /usr/bin/unzip will *not* work, as the version
they include does not have Zip64 support.
- Update the install docs to pin invoke to 0.11.1.

0.20.3 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Release fixes for deployment and intermediate DAZ > 4Gb fixes.

0.20.2 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Pin invoke to v0.11.1.  Our tasks.py is incompatible with v0.13.

0.20.1 (2016-06-13)
===================
- Try fixing Download-As-Zip for resulting zipfiles > 4Gb.  The default zip format only supports
up to 4Gb files, but the zip64 extension can handle much larger sizes.  WB hand-rolls its zips,
so the zip64 format has to be constructed manually.  Unfortunately, the fixes applied in 0.20.1
were not enough.  The remaining updates were added in 0.20.4.
- Add a Dockerfile to simplify running WaterButler in dev environments.
- Pin some dependencies and update our travis config to avoid spurious build failures.

0.20.0 (2016-04-29)
===================
- Fix Download-As-Zip for Google Drive to set the correct extensions for exported Google Doc
files.
- Add 'resource' to V1 response.
- Minor doc updates: Add urls to external API documentation and note provider quirks.

0.19.5 (2016-04-18)
===================
- Brown Paper Bag release: **REALLY** fix syntax error in Github's Unsupported Repo exception.
The 0.19.4 release fixed nothing.  I (@felliott) am an idiot.

0.19.4 (2016-04-18)
===================
- Fix syntax error in Github's Unsupported Repo exception.

0.19.3 (2016-04-15)
===================
- Increase number of files returned from a Box directory from 50 to 1000. (thanks, @TomBaxter!)
- Exclude Google Maps from Google Drive listing.  Google doesn't provide a way to export maps,
so exclude them from listing / downloading for now.  This is the same behavior as Google Forms.

0.19.2 (2016-04-14)
===================
- Make v1 move/copy return file metadata in its logging payload, so the OSF can track files
across providers.

0.19.1 (2016-04-13)
===================
- Update boto dependency to get fixes for large file uploads to Amazon Glacier. (thanks,
@caileyfitz, for your patient testing!)
- Increase number of files returned from a GDrive directory listing from 100 to 1000.

0.19.0 (2016-04-04)
===================
- Feature: WaterButler now runs on Python 3.5!  A major speed boost should be
noticeable, especially for zipped folder downloads.  All hail @chrisseto and
@TomBaxter for seeing this through!
- Feature: Zipped folder downloads now use the folder name as the zip filename.  If the folder
is the storage root, the name is `$provider.zip` (e.g. `googledrive.zip`).
- Code: WaterButlerPath has a new `is_folder` method. It's the same as `is_dir`.
- Code: waterbutler.core.BaseProvider learned `path_from_metadata`.

0.18.4 (2016-04-01)
===================
- Fix: Bump PyJWE dependency to 1.0.0 to match with OSF v0.66.0

0.18.3 (2016-03-28)
===================
- Fix: Renaming a Google doc (.gdoc, .gsheet) file should not and no longer truncates the new
filename to just the first letter.

0.18.2 (2016-03-17)
===================
- The "Leprechauns Ate My Blob" emergency release!
- Fix: Don't throw an error if the github file being requested is larger than 1Mb.  There will
be a more correct fix in the next minor release.

0.18.1 (2016-03-15)
===================
- Fix: Stop crashing if the `Content-Length` header is not set on a v1 folder create request.
A missing `Content-Length` is fine for folder create requests.

0.18.0 (2016-03-09)
===================
- BREAKING v1 API CHANGE (sortof):  Updating a file by issuing a PUT to its parent folder and
passing its name as a query parameter is no longer supported and will now throw a 409 Conflict.
This is still the correct way to create a file, but updating must be done by issuing the PUT to
the file's own endpoint.  This was supposed to be fixed back in December, but I (@felliott) did
a **very** poor job of it, meaning some providers still allowed it.  The API documentation has
been updated to match.  If you use the `/links/upload` action from the JSON-API response, you
**DO NOT** need to update your code,  That link is already correct.
- Feature: DELETEing a file or folder in the GDrive provider now sends it to the trash instead
or hard-deleting it.
- Feature: Issuing a DELETE to the storage root of a provider will now clear out its content,
but not delete the storage root itself.  This was undefined behavior before.  Some providers
would disallow it, some would crash, others would do the right thing.  This is now officially
supported.  To make sure the file contents are not wiped out on accident, the query parameter
`confirm_delete=1` must be passed when clearing the contents.  Otherwise, WB will return a 400.
- Fix: GoogleDrive provider now returns 201 Created when creating and 200 OK when overwriting
during copy operations.
- Fix: Copying / moving empty folders into a directory with a similarly named folder with 'keep
both' semantics no longer overwrites old folder and properly increments the new file name.
- Fix: Always set `kind` parameter for files and folders in v1 logging callback to avoid crashing
the OSF waterbutler logging endpoint.
- Fix: For 'keep both' conflict semantics when more than one incremented version already exists.
- Fix: Github move/copy folder requests with 'replace' semantics now correctly overwrites the
target folder, rather than merging the contents.
- Docs: @TomBaxter++ has added more docstrings to the base provider and has started documenting
the quirks of our existing providers.
- Docs: v0.18.0 WaterButler DO NOT work with python 3.5.  3.4 is required.  Mention this.
- Docs: The Center for Open Science is hiring! (thanks, @andrewsallans!)

0.17.0 (2016-02-29)
===================
- LEAP DAY RELEASE!
- Feature: Add throttling to make_request!   Some hosts don't like it when we fire off too many
requests at once.  Now we limit it to 10 requests / second and a maximum of 5 concurrently.  To
adjust the rates, update the REQUEST_LIMIT and OP_CONCURRENCY attributes in settings.py. (thanks
@chrisseto!)
- Fix: Update dropbox API urls.

0.16.5 (2016-02-22)
===================
- No changes. Applied and reverted throttling patches.

0.16.4 (2016-02-18)
===================
- Fix: Add semaphore to make_request to limit concurrent outgoing requests to 25.

===================
- Fix: Properly freeze time in tests to avoid spurious test failures.
- Update Sentry Raven client now that it has core asyncio support.

0.16.0 (2016-02-03)
===================
- Feature: Support S3 buckets with periods in their name for non-US East
regions.
- Feature: Started filling out and reorganizng the dev docs!  The v1 API is
now documented, and waterbutler.core.metadata, waterbutler.core.path have
a lot more docstrings.  A skeleton overview of WaterButler is available.  More
to come...
- Fix: Make the filesystem provider declare timezones for their modified date.
- Fix: Update FigShare's web view URL for viewing unpublished files.

0.15.1 (2016-01-21)
===================
- Fix incorrect logging of paths for move/copy task and v0 deletes
- Fix incorrect path calculation for cross-resource move/copys via Dropbox
- Properly encode googledrive path in log payloads

0.15.0 (2016-01-15)
===================
- Enforce V1 path semantics. Folders must have trailing slash, files must NOT
have trailing slash.  Failing to abide results in a 404
- Allow creating a file or folder in a directory with an identically-named
entity of the opposite type, but only for those providers that allow it.
- Fix recursive delete via s3 when folder name has special characters
- Fix multiple 500s on github provider
